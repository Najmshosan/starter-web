Families in Slamannan, Scotland (town centre inset), have seen their electricity bills jump to more than £100 a week - the equivalent of £5,000 a year - in a matter of months. Some have been forced to use food banks just so they can afford to heat their homes. The problems stem from Falkirk Council's decision to install new, eco-friendly boilers in around 900 social houses over the past 10 years. The energy supplier then hiked the prices up to an astounding rate, leaving residents such as Lisa McGregor (pictured with three of her children left), Claire Mackie (top right) and Wendy and Brian Womble (bottom right) unable to pay the bills
